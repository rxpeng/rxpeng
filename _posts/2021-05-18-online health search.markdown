**How online searches fuel health anxiety: investigating the link between health-related searches, health anxiety, and future intention**
Published on *Computers in Human Behavior*. **Rachel X. Peng** (2022)

Based on Stimulus Organism Response (S-O-R) framework, a research model was developed to illustrate the psychological mechanisms of how searching experience shapes usersâ€™ healthcare behavior (including future online search intention and health utilization intention. 

Using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach, the results shows that health information online searches will trigger health anxiety, which in turn reinforce further healthcare utilization intention. Results also show that response efficacy positively moderates the relationship between perceived illness likelihood and healthcare utilization intentions, while self-efficacy positively moderate the relationship between perceived illness likelihood and further online search intention.
