 🌱   <p> </p>
I am now a PhD candidate majoring in Mass Communication and minoring in Social Data Analytics. 
<br />

 📝   <p> </p>
My research interest lies in strategtic comm on health topics. 
<br />

 💭   
<p> </p>
I love thinking and asking questions about how people come to learn about issues of public importance and the ways in which communication can foster a better society. For instance, how people navigate health issues on a range of health topics on social media? What factors could explain the failure to distinguish between high quality and low quality content online? How could we encourage more high quality information consumption, production on social media, and to design effecitive health behaviour change interventions? 
<br />
 👨‍💻   My research particularly focus on those relationships in the digital area, where so many of our interactions now take place. My research brings together diverse perspectives which requires me to embrace diverse methodologies to better match the evolving media environment, including experimental designs, survey research and my favorite big data analytics.
