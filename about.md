<p>I am now a PhD student majoring in Mass Communication and minoring in Social Data Analytics. </p> 

<p>I love thinking and asking questions about how people come to learn about issues of public importance and the ways in which communication can foster a better society.</p>

<p>More specifically, my research focuses on how people process information on contentious health, science, and political issues. For instance, how people navigate these issues and misinformation on a range of health topics on social media? What factors could explain the failure to distinguish between high quality and low quality content online? How can we recognize and correct misinformation when we see it?</p>

<p> I use my research to investigate methods to encourage more high quality information consumption, production on social media, and to design effecitive health behaviour change interventions. I particularly focus on these relationships in the digital arena, where so many of our interactions now take place. Because my research brings together diverse perspectives, this requires me to embrace diverse methodologies to better match the evolving media environment, including experimental designs, survey research and my favorite big data analytics. </p>
